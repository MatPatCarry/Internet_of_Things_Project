# Internet of Things Project
## This is the project that I was creating during my third term for my university's classes.

It's a system which contains multiple apps which can generate data in real time, filter and aggregate data, send data to destination the user wants, and visualise it. Each app has a configuration which the user can change with an easy interface. It is built as microservices.
